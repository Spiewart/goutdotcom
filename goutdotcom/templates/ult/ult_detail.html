      It also means that, generally, there is less scientific evidence that you will benefit.

              {% elif object.num_flares == 'one' %}
              <p>ULT is generally not recommended for an individual's first gout flare.
              This is because the time that passes between flares will sometimes be as long as years and it is not necessarily worth it to take a medication daily to prevent infrequent attacks.</p>

                  <p>If you are having more than one gout flare per year, ULT is strongly recommended.
                    This is to prevent the pain and disability of recurrent flares.
                    Also, individuals who get more than one flare per year are more likely to have their gout accelerate, becoming more frequent, disabling, and causing long-term joint damage.

              They can also be seen on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan" target="_blank">CT</a> scans,  <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/cases/90545?lang=us" target="_blank">MRIs</a>, and ultrasounds of your gouty joints.
            </p>
            <p>Erosions are an indication for urate-lowering therapy.
              This is important for your long-term health because erosions are permanent changes to the bone and cartilage.
              They can be prevented with ULT, but once present can't be reversed.</p>
