<p>This means there is some general medical consensus that you would benefit from ULT (urate-lowering therapy), but it
  is not a "strong" recommendation.
  Generally, there is some scientific evidence that you will benefit, but it is not as robust as a strong recommendation.
  It is more a matter of expert opinion.</p>
<p>It's still a personal choice and you need to weigh the pros and cons of the decision for yourself.</p>

<p>Dialysis removes uric acid from your body, thus you don't need ULT (urate-lowering therapy) for this purpose.</p>
